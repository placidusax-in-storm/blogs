There are two perspectives on how to view the world:
1. Villain and victim: If something bad happens, there must be a bad person responsible, and we are the victims. Therefore, we seek revenge, directly or indirectly, as is typical for victims.
2. Cause and effect: If something bad happens, there are specific causes we can identify and address.

How we view and interpret the world determines our actions, and these actions shape our future reality. Even in relationships, there are no victims. We can end a relationship after carefully evaluating it as toxic and worthless. However, in intimate relationships like family, toxicity isn't always so clear-cut.

When we feel hurt, we often trap ourselves in a victim mindset, leading to learned helplessness. In this state, we avoid taking action to change the situation and instead wait passively for others to notice our distress and rescue us.
