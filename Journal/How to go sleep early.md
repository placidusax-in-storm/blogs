What I want: To sleep before 11:30 PM. 
Why I want it: Sleeping too late will trigger bad behavior. 
What pattern is behind that: If I take a shower late, I go to sleep late.

What strategy should I take?
1. Take a shower as soon as I get home.
2. How can I get home earlier?
3. Redesign my workday routine:
    1. 5:45 PM - Pack my dinner, then go to the gym.
    2. 7:00 PM - Return to work.
    3. 8:00 PM - Go home.
    4. 8:30 PM - Take a shower.
