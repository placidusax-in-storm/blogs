We can adjust our position within a relationship. If the relationship is not positive, we are free to end it.

After all, we have a constant source of support and love - ourselves. When others direct their negative emotions towards us through blame, yelling, or mockery, we should not be drawn in. Instead, we should remain calm and composed.

Their words and actions cannot truly threaten us. The only one who can hurt us is ourselves. We should stand up, look them in the eye, and calmly state, "Talking to me that way is unacceptable." Then, we can analyze their behavior and learn from the experience.
