What I want: To utilize my time effectively after getting home and before going to sleep. 
Why I want it: If I can use that time productively towards my goals, I will feel a sense of fulfillment, which will help prevent bad behavior.

What patterns are behind this:

1. If I have a strong, clear goal, after making some progress towards it, I am less likely to engage in bad behavior.
2. If I don't have a strong goal, I tend to default to an "auto mode" where I aimlessly wander between less harmful but meaningless information, which can then lead to negative thoughts and ultimately, bad behaviors.
3. If I end a day with bad behavior, it's more likely that I will automatically repeat those bad behaviors the next morning.

What strategy have I made:

1. Before going home, I will set a clear, achievable goal for the evening. This goal should be meaningful, but not overly difficult.
2. The last thing I do before going to sleep should be a positive activity, such as reading a short English story.
