I made a magnificent change in myself.

I quit smoking for more than 2 months, stopped unhealthy gaming, work out 3 times a week, and have been learning and improving relationships with colleagues and family.

This approach works; now I can do the right things out of habit.

However, recently, I made an even stricter plan.

I limited phone usage, tried to focus more on studying, and designed a 1.5-hour fully focused study schedule.

It worked for 2 days.

But it made me feel tired, and I lost control. It even became hard to maintain previously built healthy habits.

After two days of doing nothing, I meditated and tried to get back on the right track. I reflected and designed some new tactics for taking action:

1. I realized that relapse is an essential part of behavior control and self-management. All we need to do is keep trying, reflecting, thinking, designing tactical methods, and retrying.
2. I may have pushed myself too hard. After doing a good job, all I got was another hard job. I conveyed a bad signal to myself: it's not worth it. So I refused to take further actions. I might design a reward mechanism and create a more doable plan to relax. But before relaxing, I need to set a timer first to avoid losing control during entertainment.
3. Write it down as a journal, consult psychological knowledge from AI, search for related topics on YouTube.
4. I've decided to focus solely on coding practice. Concentrating on one area will lead to more visible improvements, providing quicker positive feedback to motivate myself.
