Often, we try so hard to make others understand what we're saying.

But what if they 100% know what we're talking about and just pretend they don't?

This is a kind of self-protection.

Sometimes, they just want to do what we want them to do.

However, it's hard to say "f**k off, leave me alone".

So they use other language: "I don't understand what are you talking about."

Even if we try to explain 10 times repeatedly.

People may consciously notice what they're doing, but what can we do about that?

First, recognize what they're doing â€” raising the cost for us to make them take action.

So, clearly, beat it by asking, "Which part don't you understand in my explanation?"

_Raise the cost for them to deny understanding what we said._

Inquire, push them to think, burden their cognitive load.

Such as.

That works, but it's limited.

Because what we're doing is forcing others to do what they don't want to do.

It would be better if we could persuade them with a common goal or, better yet, align with what they want to do.
