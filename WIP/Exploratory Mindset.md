I find that many people deconstruct this society through 'manipulation and being manipulated.'

When you discuss with them the act of lifting and then putting down a dumbbell and how it can serve as a form of exercise, they will be skeptical, doubting that you are manipulating them to lift and lower the dumbbell for your own benefit.

An exploratory mindset allows a person to learn and progress, enabling them to survive in a competitive environment.

In contrast, a closed mindset may yield short-term benefits in a small environment because it can suppress other voices and enhance one's own authority.

But the nature of a storm is that it's inevitably.

And we live in the sea, right?
