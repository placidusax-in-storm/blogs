A type class is an abstraction of types, generalizing their common traits.

In object-oriented programming (OOP) terms, examples include "Iterable" or "Observable".

These _generalize_ over _objects_.

On the other hand,

in the functional programming (FP) world, we _generalize over types_.

For example, `number` and `string` are two types that support the `add` operator.

So we generalize them as `Addable` or, in mathematical terms, a `Monoid`.
