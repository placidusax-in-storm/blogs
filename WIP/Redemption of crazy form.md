Problem

Have you ever struggled with adding logic to an incredibly complex form?

Do you feel lost in an entangled state, unsure of what happens when you change a single piece of the form's state?

Or even worse, you can't find where to add new code because you can't figure out how many varied use-cases the form has and which one the new feature should be added to.

I have.

There was a deployment application form and â€¦

Choose what needs to be changed: apply database changes, deploy pushed image, or both?

A, B, C, D

If A is chosen, B and C are automatically selected.
