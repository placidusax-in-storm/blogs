I am learning English for a long period.

5 years, may be.

I seeking for visuable improving.

I do improved but no much as I expect.

Get a high score in Toefl?

Read English book fluently?

Speak fluently?

I want that.

But what I got is trivial improvement.

I notice, It 's a dilussion that I put lots of effort in it.

All I do, is, read tecknical document, which only require most basic language skill.

Or watch some youtube video with subtitle and 90% focus on primary language translation.

  

I 've download a lots of English book, and tell myself, I 'll read it one day.

I did, but only one evening, for 3/4 pages.
