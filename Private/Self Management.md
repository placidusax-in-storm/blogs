There are two perspectives on how to view the world:

1. Villain and victim: If something bad happens, there must be a bad person responsible, and we are the victims, so we need revenge, directly or indirectly, because it is a victims likely to do
2. Cause and effect: If something bad happens, there are specific causes we can identify and fix.

How we view and interpret the world determines our actions, and these actions shape our future reality.

Even in relationships, there are no victims. We can terminate a relationship after carefully evaluating it as toxic and worthless.

However, with intimate relationships like family, toxicity isn't always so clear-cut.

When we feel hurt, we often trap ourselves in a victim mindset, leading to learned helplessness. In this state, we avoid taking action to change the situation and instead wait passively for others to notice our distress and rescue us.



If it's too hard to answer why adherence can't be maintained, it may be instructive to answer "why did it happen in the past?"

Reasoning about why things happen, then considering what factors are missing that lead to loss of a habit.

Observe, collect information, search, study, design new strategies, and return to observation.

This cycle leads to improvement.

Refusing feedback, blaming others, and avoiding negative feelings can stop critical thinking, which in turn halts personal growth.

There are two environments: the small one, which we can see, feel, touch, and is fragile; and the larger one, which is invisible but predictable, stable, and full of competition.

The big world is cold and harsh, but it rewards us if we do the right thing, making it more resilient.

The small world is safe and comfortable but is impacted by too many uncontrollable factors.

All we need to do is prepare for that big world while maintaining necessary survival work in the small world.

Listening to music, podcasts, audiobooks, and checking messages are all ways to avoid hard work. These distractions neither make time pass more quickly nor alleviate the discomfort of unfinished tasks. Instead, try to focus on work, finish the job, and reward yourself with time to read source code, journal, and read—regardless of others' opinions, which are irrelevant.

Some games are black holes for time. It's true that they are fun and helpful for skill learning. However, there are many activities that provide far greater benefits. We should guide our passion towards other pursuits that contribute more to our goals. Or play some relaxing games that don't require much practice.

We don't depend on them for anything, from economic to emotional needs, so they have no leverage to threaten us.

Love is all about helping others become better. Evil, however, hurts others while claiming it's love, just to make itself feel better.

The nature of an accident is irrelevant.

What matters is how we respond to it.

To escape negative emotions, try activities like listening to music, taking a shower, or engaging in something else you enjoy.

Don't suspend a task while waiting for the perfect state. Instead, tackle some easier tasks.

When feeling lost and out of control, resist the urge to engage in compulsive or unhealthy behavior. Instead, drink milk to calm yourself.

Stay away from pressure triggers.

To be the hero of ourselves.

Keep our story in shadow.

Consistent positive feedback is crucial for maintaining ongoing contributions to any endeavor.

Plans should be small-scale and immediately executable.

Perfectionism is an obstacle to taking action.

Learning topics should be applicable or practical in real-world situations.

Time and financial investments aren't binary decisions; balance the degree of commitment.

Avoid being trapped by self-imposed promises and the need for consistency, which is weakness.

It's human nature to seek validation. However, the most effective way to obtain it is through achieving compelling accomplishments.

Writing is a powerful tool to combat loneliness and feelings of meaninglessness.

When feeling a loss of control, watch psychological videos to increase self-awareness.

When lacking motivation, review our past achievements.

Before breaking any rules, pause to consider the motivations behind our actions, the specific triggers at play, and our current emotional state.

Minor body scratching can lead to picking our face, which is harmful.

If we start scratching our face, cleaning it immediately or switching our focus may help stop the behavior.

Picking is less about the damage to our skin and more about losing confidence in our self-control.

Completing tasks offers greater satisfaction and long-lasting pleasure.

Entertainment—such as games, videos, and fiction—is like food.

Consume it in proper amounts and at appropriate times to maximize enjoyment and relieve stress consistently.

Ceasing unhealthy behaviors bolsters our willpower and improves our well-being more rapidly than we might anticipate.

Maintain a positive attitude, even when delivering bad news.

Use positive language whenever possible.

If that's not feasible, at the very least, present events in neutral language.

Maintain positive habits even when energy is low by slowing down and relaxing.

Record it down beforehand, and spend 15 minutes thinking about why.

Don't let others control us, especially in small matters. Start with little things like choosing what to eat, drink, or take.

Project confidence by minimizing displays of hesitation, uncertainty, or self-doubt.

Instead of expressing dissatisfaction, focus on taking constructive action.

Don't hurt someone you love by using hurtful language to mock them.

Make a plan to avoid doing stupid thing in burn out.

May be rest immediately works? Say it out. Let others know that to leave a safe space.

Successful behavior control strengthens willpower, which is more important than the task itself.

Breaking self-promises damages confidence, leading to anxiety and low self-esteem—a bad deal all around.

We don't need to "solve" problems to prove something.

Instead, how we try represents who we are.

Do something to stop burnout.

Impulse gifting and consumption are often interconnected.

Impulse consumption can stem from excessive planning and the misguided belief that spending lavishly will boost self-confidence and help achieve goals. However, this approach usually proves ineffective.

At other times, impulse consumption is a form of self-compensation, which tends to be equally ineffective and can lead to regret. It's more beneficial to care for ourselves thoughtfully rather than resorting to self-compensation through spending.

Impulse gifting may arise from a desire to alleviate the regret of impulse consumption by giving away unnecessary items. This behavior, too, often results in regret.

When faced with unexpected situations, don't panic. Instead, evaluate if the situation truly matters. Determine whether the negative outcome stems from the event itself or your coping strategy.
