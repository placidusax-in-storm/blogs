Going to sleep before 11:59 PM is crucial, as lack of energy is the most negative factor affecting tomorrow's discipline.

After my workout, I feel ravenous and end up eating spicy food.

Now my stomach feels upset.

Next time, I'll try to:

1. Choose a non-spicy and healthier option like beef
2. Delay eating to weekend

Blame is essentially avoidance.

It's avoiding thinking, understanding, and designing a strategy that might work.

Why did they fail? Because they're stupid.

Why did I fail? Because I'm stupid.

All blame does is stop thinking.

Short-term results can not define who we are.

Solitude allows time for self-reflection and inner dialogue.

Collect feedback rather than seek validation from others.

Collecting feedback means thinking logically, while seeking validation from others is emotional begging and essentially an addiction to dopamine.

Thinking logically leads to improvement, whereas dopamine addiction leads to false confidence.

All that matters is awareness: thinking with awareness, speaking with awareness, gaming with awareness, studying with awareness, and reading with awareness.

Awareness provides two things:

1. Deliberate practice
2. Increased control, which leads to willpower and self-satisfaction

When fine-tuning configurations, establish clear objectives and use timers to monitor time spent.

To avoid context switching caused by prioritizing task interruptions, simply record them and finish your current task first.

Scheduling leads to pleasure, while indulgence leads to pain.

Progress itself brings more pleasure than the result.

When things turn into addiction and obsession, it causes pain.

Healthy Phone Usage Plan

Rule #1: Stop checking messages if there are no notification badges.

Rule #2: Before picking up the phone, clearly state to myself what I'm going to do.

Rule #3: Avoid visiting “news”. Instead, listening to discussions about current events is sufficient.

Flexibility #1: Visiting Reddit on the toilet is acceptable.

Flexibility #2: Repeatedly listening to familiar podcasts is fine.

It's true that avoiding phone distractions, focusing on what's important, and following a disciplined, goal-oriented path can lead to happiness. However, this approach consumes a lot of self-control.

Perhaps we don't need to abandon our self-improvement plans entirely, but instead learn from our reflections on them.

Actions to Take When Relapse Occurs

1. Stop whatever you're doing and meditate immediately.
2. If meditation doesn't stop the unwanted behavior, read your journal.
3. Write down your current thoughts and feelings.
4. As a last resort, search for guidance on YouTube.

Build an isolated environment for thinking and working by stopping irrelevant conversations when focus is required.

We didn't do anything wrong, but we need to reflect, think, and try.

Daily task: Allocate at least 30 minutes each for reading, speaking practice, and coding. Choose to do these activities either in the morning or evening.

Other learning activities, such as watching YouTube, are encouraged. However, to save time on tracking, they will not be recorded for now.

Set a timer and establish clear goals before starting study sessions, workouts, or gaming.

Avoid using your phone during these activities to maintain focus.

Whenever you reach for your phone, pause and consider what specific task you need to accomplish with it.

Context decide what to say no matter in talking or writing.

Separate writing into two parts:

- Capturing thoughts
- Sharing for impact

For "sharing for impact," a well-structured approach is essential.

How we present our writing shapes readers' perceptions of us.

Low energy may be an essential part of our status. What we need is to pause, stop focusing on progress, and more importantly, concentrate on relaxation to prevent doing something devastating.

Immersing ourselves in negative information may be more harmful than we realize. While it might not immediately trigger bad behavior, it can accumulate over time and potentially lead to an outburst in the near future.

Doing nothing is not true rest

Doing nothing leads to a lack of progress, which then increases anxiety.

And when we experience that anxiety, we deceive ourselves into doing nothing under the guise of rest.

This creates a vicious cycle.

It's difficult to fall asleep at night because we've been inactive during the day

Consider carefully how much to invest in a conflict.

What's important is not winning or losing, but how the fight strengthens us.

Conflict avoidance may stem from childhood experiences—when parents fight, we become scared and wrongly blame ourselves.

We often believe conflicts are "win or die" situations, but this isn't true. In reality, this mindset is an excuse to avoid learning.

Conflicts offer numerous opportunities to develop valuable skills. The first crucial skill to master is managing fear and anger.

In argument.

Confirm what we perceive as unusual, ensuring we fully understand what we disagree with.

Avoid long or multiple sentences. Speak in short segments, gauging the listener's response.

Don't let others interrupt you. Assert yourself by saying, "Let me finish my thought!"

Ideas spread if:

1. They are helpful
2. They appear to be helpful

First, spread the information wider to collect more data and gather feedback. Then, carefully draw a conclusion.

Choose your opponent carefully.

We can try, but don't take it too far.

In a conflict, anger is a tool for gaining advantage, not for self-harm.

Maintain a firm stance and steady eye contact.

Training for confrontations is beneficial, but don't expect to win every time.

Avoid provoking your opponent unnecessarily.

Focus on winning strategies. Emotion is a tool, but it's the weakest one.

In group settings, a powerful strategy is to gain others' support, influence their emotions, and guide their actions.

In group conflicts, consider yourself a manager rather than a weak individual seeking support.

We are lions; they are sheep.

To guide others' emotions, demonstrate logic and project confidence.

Losing a fight isn't failure; practice is the goal.

Only make promises when asked, and keep them flexible.

Observe first, learn second, speak third, and promise last.

Learn how to argue, bargain, and gain as much advantage as possible—that's diplomacy.

Don't make unequal or unfair deals for the sake of safety.

People come together for battle; be a fighter.

When facing a challenge, avoid responding, confirming, or rejecting immediately.

Instead, ask for more details with questions like "What are your main points?" and "What evidence supports your argument?"

Projecting confidence and authority fosters respect and establishes leadership.

Treat office spaces as professional work environments.

Avoid unnecessary small talk at colleagues' desks.

Likewise, protect your own workspace from interruptions.

When providing assistance, do so thoughtfully, weighing both costs and benefits.

Establish a higher bar for help requests by requiring written problem statements.

Aim to offer guidance rather than mere servitude.

Make life easier by avoiding problems rather than solving them.

Linking results to identity can be problematic when outcomes are poor.

This often leads to emotional reactions and a refusal to analyze the situation, resulting in repetitive actions.

Instead, it's more beneficial to view results as feedback.

Reflect on your actions, reason through what happened, identify connections, and plan your next attempt.

Every attempt should strengthen us, not weaken our self-esteem.

It's a normal process to experience behavioral relapses.

The key is learning from these relapses.

Reading Source Code Effectively

Starting from the first line of open-source code rarely proves effective.

Instead, immerse yourself in the context by watching related videos and reading blogs.

Afterward, you'll likely find specific code sections or summaries worth exploring—and perhaps even blogging about.

Seeking feedback for learning English?

Consider establishing a daily routine first.

A consistent routine often doesn't require extensive feedback.

Reflecting on your accomplishments can be a powerful motivator to persist.

Is seeking the perfect reading material unrealistic?

This question may not need a definitive answer.

It originates from a perfectionist mindset that aims to solve problems completely and permanently.

Instead, adopt a simpler approach: search, try, and read. If a particular material doesn't resonate with you, simply move on to the next.

Looking to incorporate English reading into your daily routine?

Consider these two guidelines when using a reading app:

1. Prioritize comfort over perfection.
2. Focus on consistency rather than duration; practice at the same time each day.
    - For instance, read every weekday before bedtime.

The aim is to make reading a sustainable daily habit, emphasizing consistency over efficiency.

Engage in valuable activities rather than remaining idle.

Idleness often leads to rumination, overthinking, and anxiety, which consume willpower and self-control as we try to regulate these negative thoughts and feelings.
