The language we use with others is often reflected back to us.

Not all truths are helpful. Consider carefully which messages and feedback are important to convey.

If we're not willing to listen to something ourselves, we shouldn't say it to others.

Respect and good intentions are the most important things in social interactions.

Respect others, don't try to change their minds, and use kind language for both others and yourself.

Avoid judging others and ourselves.

Show kindness, focus, chill, and happiness.

Speak less, slowly, and with information density.

No response is a response to being disturbed. If we don't respect others' right not to be disturbed, others won't take our words seriously.

Interesting topics are best left for suitable contexts and times to discuss. Just like food, how it tastes depends on when it's consumed.

Social rule#1 listen more than speaking

In cooperation, rule #1 is "what you will get if we cooperate."

Different narrative approaches can influence how people perceive a situation as either a loss or a gain.

Authoritative language helps build credibility.

Emotional outbursts undermine it.

Illogical conclusions also diminish authority.

Irrelevant statements that disregard context further weaken it.

Everything we present—whether code, speech, or writing—builds impact.

Authority is the foundation of impact.

It's an effective tool to reduce the cost of leadership.

Reasoning about others' actions or behaviors with positive or negative assumptions is unhelpful.

This approach often leads to emotional reactions and superficial conclusions.

Instead, it's more productive to analyze situations in terms of triggers, actions, and results.

This method enables the design of new strategies and ultimately contributes to improvement.

Avoid long sentences.

Use short ones and observe feedback.

Many of my personal preferences, thoughts, goals, and plans should remain private. Oversharing can diminish their impact, much like how magic loses its allure once explained. People are wired to be intrigued by mystery rather than to be explicitly taught or to ponder deeply. Often, others form impressions of us based on the image we project, not on our true selves, and they do so intuitively rather than through logical reasoning.

It's true that maintaining decent relationships with others is important.

However, what matters most is not how these relationships contribute to our goals, but rather that they don't hold us back.

So it's a necessary investment, but with potentially low returns.

Stop talking about me.

Speak when others are listening.

Present points carefully, considering the situation before presenting:

1. Why are you saying this?
2. What are the potential costs?
3. Will others agree with or be interested in this?
4. Can we gather others' opinions first?

Choose gifts thoughtfully, considering both what to give and when; avoid being cheap.

Valuable information is paid only. Do not share such information freely, especially for poor validation.

How we are treated depends not on our kindness, but on the value we provide.

Do not provide business advice that turns you into a seller.

The story you tell to anyone is the story you tell to everyone.

Avoid undermining your self-worth by seeking validation in relationships—a behavior often associated with low self-esteem.

Avoid self-deprecating humor, as it can undermine your dignity.

Similarly, refrain from joking at others' expense, as it may encourage them to reciprocate.

Talk about your environment, not yourself.

Focusing excessively on your appearance can indicate a lack of confidence.

Abandon toxic, unequal relationships.

These are failed investments; we have nothing to gain in situations where inequality is firmly established.

Cutting our losses is the best course of action. Don't overthink it—develop new strategies and apply them next time.

Strive for improvement, but avoid immersing ourselves in self-doubt or excessive analysis.

Remember, every word contributes to an effect rather than serving as mere catharsis.

A lack of response often leads to repetitive communication, which can suggest a lack of authority. Instead of issuing repeated commands, try a different approach: wait for a response. If none comes, ask for their proposed solutions.

Social interactions primarily consist of two components:

1. Demonstrating value
2. Exchanging information

If a meeting doesn't contribute to these objectives, it may be considered unproductive.

Let go of sunk costs.

Don't waste time to "be nice".

We don't need to answer every question, nor do we need to say "stop" or lie.

Skillfully guide the conversation to avoid divulging private information.

Don't ask for pity.

Praise others when they show their achievements.

When dining with others, there's no need to rush your eating to avoid making them wait.

It's unhealthy and an unnecessary self-sacrifice.

What we say to others can be revealing, even if the topic seems insignificant. It's not about the subject matter, but about trust.

Learn to say no skillfully.

Begin with logical arguments, then appeal to emotions if necessary.

Consider feedback and develop strategies accordingly.

View disagreements as valuable opportunities for practice.

Gradually guide others towards a new communication style, helping to rebalance relationships.

What we say reflects how others perceive us.

Attend parties to relax and practice social skills without feeling obligated.

Politely decline requests that conflict with your preferences.

Expecting perfection from others in terms of investment, trust, and reciprocity is unrealistic.

Like everything else in life, relationships have limitations and flaws.

The mature approach is to nurture the positive aspects while minimizing the negative ones.

Recognize that people are complex, with both strengths and weaknesses.

Completely relying on someone else is childish behavior—instead, strive for balanced, adult relationships.

If you want to stop others' bad behavior, ask "why," "how," and "what" to increase their cost.

The value others see in us is not what we give, nor what we want to give, but what we can give.
